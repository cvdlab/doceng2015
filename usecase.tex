\section{Use case}\label{use-case}






% Among the many activities of R\&D Sogei, we are now analyzing the
% computingofposition data during the transition between outdoor and
% indoorscenarios. In orderto achieve our purpose we are experimenting
% severaltechnologies, such asGNSS (Global Navigation Satellite system), WI­FI,
% LTE(Long Term Evolution),SDR(Software Defined Radio).






% We are now trying to
% verify the possibility to perform a realtime control over the maintenance
% workflow in a complex Data Center. 


% Inparticular, wehave to support the process of those in charge of carrying out
% the ticket­maintenance reaching, as quick as possible and without error, the
% right sub­system (inside the rightrack among thousands). We will call them the
% ‘maintenance man’. The real­time awareness of the relative positions between
% the ‘maintenance man' andthe rack ­ containing the sub­system ­ will help us
% reducing intervention times and increasing safety. If you knew when the
% maintenance process starts, you couldautomatically move,in real time,
% services, that is virtual machines, to other systems,thus
% maintainingcontinuity of services and, in the same time, reducing the
% globalrisk factor. Whenmaintenance is over, and the technician moves away, you
% couldinstantly restore thepre­existing conditions of services, that is,
% immediately after havingperformed anoutright test.
